I'm an engineer in Raleigh, NC.

I've been writing software for about ten years. Most of my experience is in web applications, doing full-stack work all the way from the ingress point down to the frontend, API, and infrastructure.

Right now I lead a team building analytics software for internal customers at Salesforce. It's mostly React, Python, and Postgres, although in a past gig I went pretty deep on Rails and Ember.

I still miss some things about Ember...
